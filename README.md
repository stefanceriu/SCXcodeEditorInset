# SCXcodeEditorInset
SCXcodeEditorInset is a Xcode plugin that adds an empty (configurable) space to the end of the editor text view

The amount of empty space is configurable through the View/Editor Inset/Size slider which goes from full page height to zero. It defaults to 30%, as highlighted in the screenshot.
