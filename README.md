# SCXcodeEditorInset
SCXcodeEditorInset is a Xcode plugin that adds an empty (configurable) space to the end of the editor text view 
![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12748201/Recordings/SCXcodeEditorInset/SCXcodeEditorInset.png)

The amount of empty space is configurable through the View/Editor Inset/Size slider which goes from full page height to zero. It defaults to 30%, as highlighted in the screenshot.
